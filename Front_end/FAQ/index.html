      Why can't I see the Columbia Sports Token (CST)  in Metamask automatically?

    </button>
    <div class="acc-content">
      <p>
        You may have noticed that MetaMask displays some standard tokens such as ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens that have been minted on  Ethereum but  its token list isn’t exhaustive. You can add CST tokens to Metamask Wallet.
        <br><br><br>
        1) Open Metamask. If you already have the metamask chrome extension,  you should be able to view the Metamask icon on the top left hand corner.
        <br><br>
        2) Click on “Ethereum Mainnet”  at the upper right-hand corner and select the “Rinkeby Test Network”.
        <br><br>
        3)
        Click on “Add Token” on the bottom on the same page. 
        <br><br>
        4)
Fill in Token Contract Address with: x
And you will see the Token Symbol and Token Decimal have been automatically filled in once the Token Contract Address has been filled.
<br><br>
5)
Click on “next” and  “Add Tokens” .
<br><br>
6)
CST token should appear in your wallet alongside your other tokens.
